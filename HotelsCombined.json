    "comment": "Booked the deluxe ocean view room, and the view did not disappoint! Our room (SE173) was quite low, which meant easy walkable access to the restaurant, big pool and beach. Also it means we had a beautiful oceanfront view, instead of a view of roofs for the higher bay rooms. Initially a bit upset with the hospitality, as I emailed them multiple times regarding a private dinner booking before getting a reply. After which it takes on average two follow up emails across the week to extract the next reply from them. The front office receptionists were very helpful and friendly. Both electronic locks on our doors were not functioning (please remember to check), and they quickly sent over a staff to fix it. It took quite a bit of time to fix. One of the nights we ordered grab delivery, but we waited over half an hour after the front desk called to tell me food has arrived. Turns out the staff came and rang the bell, we did not come to the door, left, and the front office called our room. In quite an impolite tone questioned us if we were in our room and told us off for not opening the door. We were very confused as we have been waiting all along in the room by the door, but never heard anything. Turns out the bell is not working as well. A big upset we were accused wrongly when it was their faulty doorbell. Not anyone’s fault but the attitude could be better. After reflecting these issues to the front office, they were very quick to send a staff to check the bell as well as to address our concerns.",

Don’t worry about insects and lizards inside the rooms. Try the SPA it’s worth the money. One important note for those who want full privacy: swimming pools might not be with full privacy, it’s open to other villas, but my room (high bay signature) had full privacy at the top of the bay no one can see my pool however I can see other villas and swimming pools. The rooms are fully surrounded with glass doors with no walls but it’s covered with curtains, it’s amazing but not to those who want full privacy. You can close the curtains but keep in mind if you opened it everyone can see inside your room. It’s a bit isolated so it’s suitable for those who really want to RELAX",

To make matters worse, the air conditioning was not working well and made loud noises during our last night there. It's quite frustrating......",

Another thing is that the private beach infront of the hotel is really rocky, you are not able to swim in it. So its only good to watch and listen the waves. Service and staff were really good and attentive. Breakfast had a wide variety but just so so.",

The Wiwa restaurants was excellent choice for breakfast and in-room dining with reasonable prices and a variety of options. Cons:, The room rate is over proced. I was assigned to Villa 15/3 with partial sea view (only available at the time) however, I couldn’t see the sea at all from Villa, the view was covered by trees. I requested secluded pool (privacy for Muslim ladies), yet, the Villa behind us ; (actually on top of us in the hill) exposed the whole pool. My wife couldn’t enjoy swimming as planned and expected. Nevertheless, we tried to enjoy our stay, but I would think twice before reserving again in the same resort. It won’t completely fit conservative families.",

You get a better chance if you get one in the high area for a better view too but higher price Highly recommend the massage and book before sunset to go for a sunset drink in the lounge above the spa Location is far from the city, only close to patong beach. Also a bit difficult to find a taxi Not much to do at night as the one restaurant is usually empty Amazing beach and good breakfast I would definitely go again",

The hotel rooms were awesome, and getting there was simple with the hotel rides- never waited more than 1 minute to get a car. Only issue was that there should be more signs and lights near the stairways to get around - first 2 days we were kind of lost walking around (it's A LOT of steps). Also GRAB is your best friend - pick up and drop off to the hotel was pretty simple (just dark and hilly on the way to the hotel). Overall pretty awesome place! Everything in the city was about a 12-15 minute ride!",

We had the 3 bedrooms signature pool villa, the view is wonderful and rooms are spacious and clean. The only comments I have is on the room furniture as it’s a bit old and need to renovated; I have seen some rooms undergoing renovation during our stay. Another note about the rooms; each room is located on a different floor; It wasn’t convenient as I was traveling with young kids. The staff was super nice, and cooperative I would definitely visit the facility again when come to Phuket; I wish they finish the renovation soon",

    "comment": "Heard a lot good comments about the resort for the unique design and also the nice view to the sea and of course it was amazing as expected! However valuing with the money that we have paid and for the food standard for Phuket Resort, I think the hotel restaurant was a bit of downfall for our stay! We arrived the resort around noon and because our room was not ready yet, we went for lunch in the restaurant. Since it has been 3 years since our last visit to Thailand, opting for Thai food was a must at the time with all those craves! So we ordered a chicken satay, a seafood fried rice and baffalo wings. All these dishes are like the basics yet the chicken quality of the satay was quite hard to chew with no tenderness, the fried rice had very plain taste and at some point we thought maybe the chef forgot to add in salt or other essential ingredients. For the first night dinner we stayed in the hotel and thought we would give it another try for their western food so that time we order a Tom Yum soup, Spaghetti Aglio and Angus beef steak. The spaghetti was way to spicy for Aglio style and the Tom Yum was a bit plain for the Tom Yum. Once again the taste seems to be at different dishes unexpectedly. During our stay in Phuket the weather was soooo good and everyone opted out for the sun on the beach and swimming pool. There was one day it was so crowded and there were no vacancy for the sunbathing chair. We searched and waited for sometime till we found two large beanbags that was left lying around and no staff actually attended us at all. Then the next day we decided to get the sunbathing chairs earlier and make sure we had a spot so we went to the pool before breakfast at 9.30. Overall it was a peaceful stay however we expected for more attentive hospitality and outstanding catering.",

On a rainy day, the Sky bar kept us company. To bring it all together, a stellar breakfast every morning. Above all, the lighting, architecture & design speaks volumes about Naka’s healthy obsession to detail.",

The way towards the hotel is really bad and scary with no street light for 7-8 minutes and the path way is towards the hotel and they should be responsible for the lights…. Any how 0 privacy the rooms beside us can see the swimming pool clearly I will be writting a very bad review about this resort .. we are from uae and its not suitble for Arabs and muslim families ..will make sure of it you show something in the pictures and its was something else We went to another resort previously it was the best ever Any ways i dont not suggest any arab to visit it and will write it on all the hotel websites Upset",

However, sometimes the shuttle bus is very slow and have to wait for more than 10 mins (you have to take the hotel's shuttle bus to go around the hotel's property) For the villa, it is very minimal and very photogenic as well. but inside the villa is very dusty because the room is all surrounded with curtains.",
